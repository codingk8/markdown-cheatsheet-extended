## The project

### What this project does

##### Project original Users stories:

1. I can see a `main` element with a corresponding `id="main-doc"`, which contains the page's main content (technical documentation)
1. Within the `#main-doc` element, I can see several `section elements`, each with a class of `main-section`. There should be a minimum of 5
1. The first element within each `.main-section` should be a `header` element which contains text that describes the topic of that section
1. Each `section` element with the class of `main-section` should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each `header` contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The `section` that contains the header "Javascript and Java" should have a corresponding `id="Javascript_and_Java"`)
1. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least 10 `p` elements total (not each)
1. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least 5 `code` elements total (not each)
1. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least 5 `li` items total (not each)
1. I can see a `nav` element with a corresponding `id="navbar"`
1. The navbar element should contain one `header` element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation
1. Additionally, the navbar should contain link (`a`) elements with the class of `nav-link`. There should be one for every element with the class `main-section`
1. The `header` element in the navbar must come before any link (`a`) elements in the navba
1. Each element with the class of `nav-link` should contain text that corresponds to the `header` text within each `section` (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world")
1. When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the `main-doc` element (e.g. If I click on a `nav-link` element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a `section` element that has that id and contains the corresponding `header`
1. On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with `id="navbar"` should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user
1. My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query
