## The project

### What this project does

##### Project original Users stories:

1. I can see a `main` element with a corresponding `id="main-doc"`, which contains the page's main content (technical documentation)
1. Within the `#main-doc` element, I can see several `section elements`, each with a class of `main-section`. There should be a minimum of 5
1. The first element within each `.main-section` should be a `header` element which contains text that describes the topic of that section
1. Each `section` element with the class of `main-section` should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each `header` contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The `section` that contains the header "Javascript and Java" should have a corresponding `id="Javascript_and_Java"`)
1. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least 10 `p` elements total (not each)
